- error: "cannot find symbol"
  explanation: "It looks like you're using a <word data-key=\"variable\">variable</word> you haven't defined.<br/><br/> Or maybe you wanted to use a <word data-key=\"string\">String</word>, but you didn't surround it in double quotation marks. When you leave off the double quotes, Java interprets the letters as part of a variable rather than as literal characters.<br/><br/><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-java\"><code>hello\t\t\t//A variable called hello\n\"hello\"\t\t\t//The string \"hello\"</code></pre>"

- error: "'(' or '[' expected"
  explanation: "Are you missing a pair of parentheses somewhere?"
  reference:
- error: "')' expected"
  explanation: "It looks like your code's missing a close parenthesis.<br/><br/>In Java, every open (left or <code>(</code>) parenthesis has to be matched by a close (right or <code>)</code>) parenthesis before your program can run."
  reference:
- error: "might not have been initialized"
  explanation: "One of your variables on that line didn't get an initial value before it was used."

- error: "incompatible types"
  explanation: "You might be assigning a variable when you mean to be comparing it.<br/><br/><word data-key=\"=\">=</word> assigns values to variables and <word data-key=\"==\">==</word> asks whether two things are equivalent."

  explanation: "Are you using a variable you haven't yet defined?"
  reference:
- error: "missing return statement"
  explanation: "Your code isn't <word data-key=\"return\">returning</word> when Java thinks it should. Are you <word data-key=\"print\">printing</word> instead? Does the function end without returning the correct <word data-key=\"type\">type</word>?"

- error: "unclosed string literal"
  explanation: "Your double quotes don't match, so Java couldn't tell where your <word data-key=\"string\">String</word> stopped. Set off your String with double quotes at its start and end (e.g. <code>\"hello\"</code>)"

- error: "Syntax error, insert \";\""
  explanation: "Your line needs a semicolon <code>;</code> at its end."
  reference:
- error: "cannot return a value from method whose result type is void"
  explanation: "Your code is <word data-key=\"return\">returning</word> in a place it can't. Did you mean to <word data-key=\"print\">print</word> a variable instead?<br/><br/>If you'd like to return, you'll need to change the method's return type from <word data-key=\"void\">void</word> to whichever <word data-key=\"type\">type</word> you're returning."

- error: "'else' without 'if'"
  explanation: "It looks like you're using an else statement without a prior <word data-key=\"if-else\">if statement</word>.<br/><br/>Else statements can only be used after if statements. If you want to run <em>only</em> the code inside the 'else', you should delete the if-else block.<br/><br/>Or, if you think you've got an <code>if</code> before your <code>else</code>, the block's curly braces <code>{}</code> might not match or your if condition <code>if ( ... )</code> might end with a semicolon rather than a left curly brace <code>{</code>."
